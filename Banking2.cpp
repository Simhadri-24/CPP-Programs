/*Develop a C++ program using Inheritance for a bank
  application.Consider a bank providing two types of accounts
  to its customers, SB Ac and Current Ac. Both accounts have
  some common features but they also have some unique
  features of their own.
 The common features for both accounts are:
     i)Data members: (i) Ac no. (i) Name (ii) Acc. Balance
     ii)Member functions: ) Deposit (Ã¼i) Withdraw. (iii) Minimum bal. penalty
     iii)Unique for SB Acc. is ATM Card no. (Data member).
Unique for CA overdraft facility (member function). During
withdraw, if the balance is not sufficient, it should call
this function to release the amount and store negative balance
for the account. Example, if balance is 5000 and withdraw
amount is 6000, then withdraw function should call this
overdraft function to sanction the amount and update the
balance as -1000.
The minimum balance penalty will be calculated for Rs 1000 in
the case of SB ACC and Rs 5000 in the case of CA. The penalty
amount is Rs 100 for both accounts.
Now define a base class Bank and two derived classes (SB) and
(CA) with appropriate members for each class.*/
